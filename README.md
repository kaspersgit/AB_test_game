# AB_test_game

In the `report.ipynb` the final report on the AB test can be found with working code.
Exploration and try out of different approaches have been done in the `exploration.ipynb`
notebook but are not promised to still work.

The `helper_function` folder contains a few custom made functions to not clutter the `report.ipynb` too much.
